# Data Flow

## Medical Note Creation Process
1. User selects note type (Admission, Progress, Consultation, ICU variants)
2. Structured form collection for relevant medical systems
3. Medication list compilation (manual entry + image extraction)
4. AI-powered note generation with medical terminology
5. Review and export of formatted medical documentation

## Medication Processing Pipeline
1. Image upload and base64 encoding
2. OCR text extraction via Google Cloud Vision
3. AI-powered medication parsing (Claude/Gemini)
4. Medication database matching for standardization
5. Integration into medical note context

## Internationalization Flow
- Context-based language switching (English â†” French)
- Medical terminology translation for generated notes
- Locale-specific formatting for dates and measurements
